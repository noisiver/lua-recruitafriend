# Recruit-A-Friend
This script adds five new in-game commands that allows players to recruit each other.

While logged in, use **.recruit help** to get some information on how to use the feature.

The amount of days that a referral will stay active, the amount of days since the account was created where it can still be recruited, the amount of days since the referral that is required before the account receives special rewards can all be changed by modifying the script.

The possible, and configurable, rewards are the Swift Zhevra, the X-53 Touring Rocket and the Celestial Steed.

# Requirements
